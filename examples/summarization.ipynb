FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) A well-informed citizenry is essential for the well-\\n        being of a democratic society.\\n            (2) Access to Government information is essential for \\n        citizens who seek to make the Federal Government accountable \\n        for its actions.\\n            (3) The public should have timely, complete, equitable, and \\n        affordable access to Government information.\\n            (4) Federal agencies should use modern information \\n        technology for the benefit of citizens of the United States.\\n            (5) Government information is a national resource that \\n        should be treated as a public good.\\n            (6) Government information is a valuable economic asset \\n        that belongs to the public.\\n            (7) Taxpayers pay for the creation, collection, and \\n        organization of Government information and should not be \\n        required to pay excessive fees to receive and use that \\n        information.\\n            (8) It is unnecessarily difficult for citizens to provide \\n        Federal agencies with comments and suggestions on Federal \\n        information policies. As a result, many Federal agencies do not \\n        take into account the public interest in the information \\n        resources they manage.\\n            (9) Federal agencies have been slow in developing standards \\n        for record and file formats, software query command structures, \\n        and other important topics that will make Government \\n        information easier to obtain and use.\\n            (10) Many Federal agencies do not provide timely access to \\n        Government information products and services at reasonable \\n        costs.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (referred \\n        to in this section as the ``CBO'') predicts that health \\n        insurance premiums will increase by $2,100 for millions of \\n        families by 2016 as a result of the Democrats' health overhaul.\\n            (2) The Obama Administration's own actuaries at the Centers \\n        for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (referred to in this section \\n        as the ``CMS'') predict that, ``[N]ational health expenditures \\n        under the health reform act would increase by a total of \\n        $311,000,000,000 (0.9 percent) during calendar years 2010-\\n        2019'' as a result of the Democrats' health overhaul.\\n            (3) The CMS actuaries predict that 14,000,000 Americans \\n        would lose their employer-sponsored insurance as a result of \\n        the Democrats' health overhaul.\\n            (4) The Democrats' health overhaul penalizes Americans who \\n        save money to pay for their health care and threatens to reduce \\n        the value of the health benefits of 43,000,000 Americans with \\n        Flexible Spending Arrangements and Health Savings Accounts.\\n            (5) CBO estimates the Democrats' health overhaul slashes \\n        Medicare by more than one-half trillion dollars in order to \\n        fund a new Government entitlement program.\\n            (6) The Medicare actuaries found these Medicare cuts to be \\n        so drastic that they caution, ``providers for whom Medicare \\n        constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find \\n        it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative \\n        intervention, might end their participation in the program \\n        (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)''.\\n            (7) The CMS actuaries predict 7,000,000 Medicare \\n        beneficiaries will no longer be enrolled in a Medicare \\n        Advantage plan and millions of seniors who are currently \\n        enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan will see their benefits \\n        slashed and out-of-pocket costs increase.\\n            (8) According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \\n        CBO, the Democrats' health law contains a total of \\n        $569,200,000,000 in tax increases, including a dozen separate \\n        provisions that break President Obama's pledge to avoid tax \\n        increases on middle-class Americans earning less than $200,000 \\n        per year and families earning less than $250,000 per year.\\n            (9) The national unemployment rate remains near 10 percent.\\n            (10) CBO estimates that the Democrats' health overhaul will \\n        raise taxes on employers who fail to provide Government-\\n        approved health insurance to their employees by \\n        $52,000,000,000.\\n            (11) CBO said that ``employees largely bear the cost of . . \\n        . [employer mandate] fees in the form of lower wages''.\\n            (12) The costs incurred by businesses who avoid the tax by \\n        complying with the employer mandate may also be felt by \\n        potential workers (who will have fewer employment opportunities \\n        as businesses respond to the mandate by reducing additional \\n        hiring) and by consumers (who may have to pay more for goods \\n        and services to offset the higher costs imposed on businesses \\n        by the mandate).\\n            (13) The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more \\n        than 3,000,000 businesses and organizations, said the \\n        Democrats' health overhaul, ``will not increase coverage-rather \\n        it will lead to out-sourcing, off-shoring, hiring of \\n        independent contractors, spinning-off small new companies, \\n        reducing workforces, and reducing wages''.\\n            (14) The National Federation of Independent Business, which \\n        represents 350,000 small businesses, said through mandates, \\n        ``employees ultimately bear the cost of their health insurance \\n        through lower employment, depressed wages, depressed \\n        productivity, and loss of economic opportunities''.\\n            (15) CBO found that 3,900,000 Americans would pay \\n        $17,000,000,000 in taxes for not purchasing Government-approved \\n        health insurance and that nearly half of these taxes would be \\n        paid by families earning less than 300 percent of the Federal \\n        poverty level.\\n            (16) The Internal Revenue Service may have to hire as many \\n        as 16,500 additional agents, auditors, and other workers to \\n        enforce all the new taxes and penalties in the Democrats' \\n        health overhaul, dangerously expanding the Government's reach \\n        into the lives of virtually every American.\\n            (17) The CMS actuaries predict the nearly $110,000,000,000 \\n        in new health care industry taxes in the Democrats' health \\n        overhaul will be passed onto consumers in the form of higher \\n        premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\\n            (18) The subsidies for individuals and families (who earn \\n        less than 400 percent of the Federal poverty level) in the \\n        Democrats' health overhaul are structured in a way that will \\n        financially punish married couples. For example, a woman \\n        earning $32,000 in 2016 who gets married to a man earning the \\n        same amount will pay an average marriage penalty of $9,640 \\n        versus what they would have paid for health coverage had they \\n        not married.\\n            (19) The rapid phase-out of the premium tax credits, when \\n        combined with existing income and payroll tax rates, create \\n        effective marginal tax rates exceeding 100 percent in certain \\n        cases, thus destroying any incentive to work harder and earn \\n        more income.\\n            (20) The so-called ``Patient-Centered Outcomes Research \\n        Institute'' paves the way for Government-sanctioned rationing \\n        of life-saving treatments by allowing the coverage of health \\n        care treatments and services to be based on how much those \\n        treatments and services cost.\\n            (21) The CMS actuaries predict the program to help cover \\n        the sickest Americans will be so inadequately funded that \\n        premiums will have to increase ``substantially'' to maintain \\n        solvency.\\n            (22) The CMS actuaries estimate 18,000,000 Americans will \\n        be dumped into Medicaid, a program in which they are likely to \\n        have a difficult time finding a doctor to treat them, as a \\n        result of the Democrats' health overhaul.\\n            (23) The Medicaid expansion in the Democrats' health \\n        overhaul will force States to spend an additional \\n        $20,000,000,000 on their Medicaid programs at time where the \\n        vast majority of States are facing a budget crisis.\\n            (24) The 2010 budget deficit currently stands at \\n        $1,400,000,000,000 and the national debt totals \\n        $12,000,000,000,000.\\n            (25) The CMS actuaries exposed the Democrats' budget \\n        gimmicks, saying a new Government-run long-term care program \\n        that Democrats have touted as saving $72,000,000,000 over the \\n        next ten years will ``face a significant risk of failure'' and \\n        also that ``the improved [Medicare] financing cannot be \\n        simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays (such as \\n        the coverage expansions) and to extend the trust fund''.\\n            (26) CBO estimates the House Republican health reform bill \\n        would reduce premiums across the board by up to $1,050 \\n        annually.\\n            (27) The House Republican health reform bill would not cut \\n        Medicare or increase taxes.\\n            (28) CBO estimates the Republican health reform bill would \\n        reduce the Federal deficit by $68,000,000,000 over the next 10 \\n        years.\\n            (29) As of introduction of this bill, 21 State attorneys \\n        general are suing the Federal Government, challenging the \\n        constitutionality of the Democrats' new health care law.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress makes the following findings:\\n            (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, signaled a \\n        turning point in United States foreign policy.\\n            (2) Al Qaeda and affiliated groups have established a \\n        terrorist network with linkages in Afghanistan, Pakistan, \\n        throughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, and around \\n        the world.\\n            (3) The war on terrorism requires that the United States \\n        consider the Greater Middle East and Central Asia as a \\n        strategic region with its own political, economic, and security \\n        dynamics.\\n            (4) While rich in cultural, geographic, and language \\n        diversity, the Greater Middle East and Central Asia face common \\n        impediments to economic development and political freedom.\\n            (5) Although poverty and economic underdevelopment do not \\n        alone cause terrorism, the expansion of economic growth, free \\n        trade, and private sector development can contribute to an \\n        environment that undercuts radical political tendencies that \\n        give rise to terrorism.\\n            (6) Given the relationship between economic and political \\n        development and winning the global war on terror, America's \\n        support for freedom in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia \\n        must be matched with expanded and new programs of partnership \\n        with the people and governments of the region to promote good \\n        governance, political freedom, private sector development, and \\n        more open economies.\\n            (7) The United States and other donors should support those \\n        citizens of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia who share \\n        our desire to undertake reforms that result in more open \\n        political and economic systems.\\n            (8) Turkey, which should be supported in its aspirations \\n        for membership in the European Union, plays a pivotal and \\n        unique role in efforts to bring economic development and \\n        stability to the Greater Middle East and Central Asia.\\n            (9) The President should seek new mechanisms to work \\n        together with European and other nations, as well as with the \\n        countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia to \\n        promote political and economic development in the Greater \\n        Middle East and Central Asia.\\n            (10) Because the dynamics of the Greater Middle East and \\n        Central Asia have a serious impact on global security, the \\n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should now shift its \\n        strategic focus to the region, including expanded roles in \\n        Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Mediterranean.\\n\\nSEC. 4.
